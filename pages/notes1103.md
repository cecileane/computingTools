## homework

[homework 2](https://github.com/UWMadison-computingtools/coursedata/tree/master/hw2-datamerge),
due F 11/11 (but deadline postponed to 11/15).
learning goals:
experience with Python, more experience with git,
think about algorithm strategy,
set good computing habits (project organization, documentation,
[etc](http://cecileane.github.io/computingtools/pages/notes0906.html#best-practices)).

We will **use class time** R 11/10 to work on it
and to discuss strategies in small groups.

## group work

instructions on 11/10

- Work in groups of 3 ideally, groups of 2 or 4 are fine too,
  and reshuffling groups during class is fine.
- Please change place to work with people you have not worked with before:
  great way to learn more, even if's a bit uncomfortable at first.
- Solve your errors and road blocks and questions with peers.  
  If you have solved them already, help someone else solve theirs,
  or discuss someone else's solution to discover other strategies.
- keep engaged and productive

## binomial coefficients script: con't

[here](../assets/python/binomial.py) is our final product,
with one last change (go find it!) to make the file usable as a module too.

## final project

instructions given on 11/17:

- overall [description](project1description)
